# To-Do-List-V1
This is my first web app that I shared to GitHub!

# What is a To-Do list?
A to do list is simply a list full of task or things that you're going to do in a certain way at a certain time, essentially it's a way to visually see all of your outstanding tasks in one place. 
In this version it's a simple to do list app that gets an input of your `task title` as well as the `task description` in order for you to know what should you do rather than just reading the title.

# What was your motivation?
My motivation to make this app is to simply share a simple to do list project that I've been making, and also because I'm coming back to making web apps since I was busy with school, it's a great refreshener!
And also the reason it has a "V1" on the title is because that this is the first version of my to do list, maybe in one day I'll make a far more better and cleaner as well as versatile one! Please look forward :D

# What did you learn?
In this project, I learn how to split up some messy code to a clean one, as well as making functions that makes it easier to maintain and read. And also learn about local storages and how to store them in an optimized way!

# How does it work?
It works really easy! 

First give in the `title` of the task and also the `description` of the task, then it'll automatically create a task card for you!
If you need to delete it, just click the button on the upper right of the task card!

* **Q : Why should I input both title and description of the task?**
* **A: Because with this feature, you can give more thoughts into the task rather than just the title. Think of the description as a short guide that adds context, motivation, or extra details to help you complete the task more effectively.**

It's still not perfect!
